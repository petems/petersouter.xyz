# Vercel preview deployment configuration
# This overrides settings from the root config.toml for Vercel deployments
# to ensure assets load correctly on preview URLs

# Use the Vercel deployment URL as base (set by Vercel automatically)
# Vercel sets HUGO_BASEURL based on deployment URL
# baseURL will be: https://[deployment-hash]-[project].vercel.app

# Disable canonifyURLs to allow relative URLs
canonifyurls = false

# Use relative URLs for all assets to avoid CORS issues
relativeURLs = true
