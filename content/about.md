I'm a developer turned operations person, turned consultant, turned pre-sales engineer turned Technical Account Manager. I've previously worked at Puppet, Kainos and Simply Business, wearing a variety of hats: developer, operations engineer, pro services engineer.

I've worn a lot of hats, but I'm a big fan of Customer Success type roles, helping out customers, whilst still
staying technical.

I'm currently happily employed as a Technical Account Manager at HashiCorp.

I enjoy working on open-source projects, so checkout my Github or my page describing some of my maintained projects.
