It's been a bit of a crazy year so far. With social distancing and working from home, I havent traveled a 
lot or done much interesting tech stuff recently, but I've had the itch to do some blogging. So lets do some food blogging!

It started with this great first-person cooking video that came up in my Youtube feed:

I've been following [Kenji](https://www.seriouseats.com/editors/j-kenji-lopez-alt) for a while, from his time at Serious Eats. He explains recipes really well, as well as being a genuine guy and great at explaining things. 

So following his video, I did a quick test runs of making spatzle:

It was super quick and easy. I did it based on Kenji's video, but the recipe from [Step-by-Step Cook](https://step-by-step-cook.co.uk/sidedishes/spaetzle/) is good, and it allows you to change between metric and imperial, and how many servings you want. 

But I wanted to do something more indulgent, something with baked, rich with a lot of cheese. I thought "Someone must've thought of making a mac-and-cheese with spetzl right?"

Answer: Yes they did - Käsespätzle!

For the recipe, I used one from [Daring Gourmet](https://www.daringgourmet.com/kaesespaetzle-swabian-german-macaroni-and-cheese/), but it's pretty much what you expect: layer spetzl with cheese and caramelized onion in pan, then bake until the cheese on top is golden brown. 

I did a quick photo breakdown of the steps:

![](/images/2020/04/flour-and-eggs.jpg)
Add the flour and eggs to a bowl and mix.

![](/images/2020/04/add-fizzy-water.jpg)
Slowly add 100-200ml of carbonated water until it forms a thick dough. Regular water or milk works too.

It should be think and come off the spoon slowly. Add flour if its too thin, more water if its too think.

![](/images/2020/04/leave-to-rest.jpg)
Leave to rest for about 30-60 minutes.

When ready, bring a pot of water to the boil and find something to push the batter through to make the spatzle. I bought a spetzl maker, but I tested it through a regular cheese grater and collinder and that works fine as well.

Pour the mixture into the device, and push it through into the boiling water. 

![](/images/2020/04/drain-spatzl.jpg)
When they float (1 or 2 minutes) take them out to drain and do the next batch. Try not to crowd the pan too much. Shock them in a bowl of cold water to firm them up. 

![](/images/2020/04/caramelized-onions.jpg)
Caramelize some chopped onions, throwing a little of the starchy water in to 

![](/images/2020/04/buttered-pan.jpg)
Butter up an oven-safe dish.

![](/images/2020/04/layer-one.jpg)
Add a third of the spetzl, a third of the caramelized onions, then a third of the cheese.

Do this and finish up with a little bigger pinch of cheese on top.

Cook until cheese is golden brown and bubbling.

Serve with greens and potato salad. I did some quick garlic butter asparagus. 

It worked out great. Super indulgent, not something you'd eat every day, but it was great comfort food.
