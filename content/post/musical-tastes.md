#### Day 7 in the #vDM30in30

## What I like...

There's an old cliche, ["I'll listen to anything...except rap and country"](https://psmag.com/i-listen-to-everything-except-rap-and-country-music-28048a1168bf#.nkmz5aasw).

I used to fall into this bucket, but then I actually realised that every genre has some amazing tracks and artists, so now I would describe my musical taste as pretty general. I tend toward the more hip-hop, electronic, easy-listening side. But since then I've broadened my horizons and will pretty much listen to anything.

I do have to admit a lot of this is because of a streak of playing Rock Band and Guitar Hero fairly obsessively when I was a student, both of which actually have a lot of music from the 60's and 70's that I hadn't really listened to before.

## When I listen...

Slowly I've basically stopped listening to music when I commute and travel, preferring podcasts or audiobooks. I find I'm normally in the mood for learning when I'm travelling, and I get bored with tracks too early if I listen to music.

Normally when I'm listening to music, I'm actually in a zone-out or coding mood. I'm looking for something to allow me to phase out of the real world a bit. There's a pop-psychology term called [firegazing](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/fire-good-make-human-inspiration-happen-132494650/?no-ist), and I feel that particularly is true when I'm coding or flicking around the internet.

## What I've been listening too

So when I code I'm normally listening to more spacey sound. I want to phase out, get in my headspace and get into
[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

One cool trend that happened recently was the rise of **Chill Anime Vines**. Basically little vignettes of mainly 90's VHS quality anime clips, accompanied by trip-hop or spacey beats in 8 second loops.

Someone made a Spotify playlist of them all, and I've added a few artists that come up a lot to my regular playlists

I've also had a few very cool spacey, trip-hop and easy listening lists and videos linked that seem to be perfect whatever mood I'm in.
