So Rob Nelson raved about `#vDM30in30`, which is a pretty cool idea to encourage yourself to blog.

Rules are pretty simple:

* Anyone can participate
* 30 posts in 30 days â€“ no specification of when you post, so it can be 5 in a day with 4 rest days ðŸ™‚
* Post to Twitter with #vDM30in30 hashtag so that people can follow along
* Itâ€™s difficult, but super helpful for spurring creativity
* Itâ€™s fun! No, seriously, it is a lot of fun being a part of this
* Word counts donâ€™t matter
* Subject is up to you
* Have fun!
* Follow along on Twitter by using the #vDM30in30

So I decided to sign-up this year, as I've got a bunch of ideas and drafts that have been left half-done, and this is the perfect excuse to hold me accountable and get me blogging some more.

So, here's me getting started early, with a Day 0 post before November actually starts! Looking forward to getting some good blogging going as the month goes on, a mix of Puppet and Devops stuff, some random thoughts about technology and fitness. Maybe even some personal stuff too!
