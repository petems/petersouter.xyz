One thing you should know about me, is I love tinkering. I always have a side-project or two on the go, and an office littered with kickstarted gadgets, half-completed projects and the various detritus of a jumbled mind.

However, everything reaches a tipping point, and in 2025 I think I was teetering on the edge of a proper burnout moment. I think I managed to just about dance-between-the-raindrops enough not to completely toast myself...but I got close a few times!

So when 2026 rolled around, in that brief lull and New Year introspection, I made a commitment: Let's do some legwork to avoid me having to sheepishly write another navel-gazing blogpost in 2027 where I wonder where the years gone...

# Environmental Scaffolding

Let's start with some foundational ideas:

- Avoid Overthinking
- Build in External Accountability
- If in doubt, do the minimum you need to do to **Do The Damn Thing**

So with that in mind, here's my first post of 2026. Boom, one deadline down.

For my next trick, I'm making the following public commitment with a specific deadline:

> I will blog 3 more times before the end of February

I'm going to share this post on LinkedIn so I have external accountability.

And to make things a bit more interesting...

If I fail to hit the end-of-February deadline, I have to post **a clearly GenAI Hustleslop LinkedIn Status about my failure to hit the first accountability deadline of the 2026**

I really don't want to do that, so let's get out there and **DO THE DAMN THING**
