It's been far too long since I've posted anything here. 2025 was an incredibly busy year, and while I've been spending a lot of time tweaking things on the edges, it felt great to finally get back on the horse and speak again at TestCon 2025.

## The Realization

Looking at my backlog recently, I realized I've been spreading myself too thin across various projects. It makes more sense to prioritize updating this website—it's been a while, and a lot has changed. The Terraform setup is several years old at this point, and the CircleCI deployment configuration is getting pretty crusty. Time to modernize.

## The Website Updates

[TODO: Expand on specific plans for updating the infrastructure]

- Terraform configuration modernization
- Moving away from CircleCI to... [GitHub Actions? Other?]
- Other infrastructure improvements

## AI, Burnout, and Finding Balance

Of course, it's almost impossible to talk about tech in 2026 without mentioning AI. It's allowed me to massively power through all the various side projects and OSS work that I enjoy doing. But I definitely hit an AI burnout moment recently.

[TODO: Elaborate on the AI experience - what worked, what didn't, specific examples]

I'm trying to scale back now and stick to closing off existing projects and doing things that genuinely make me happy. Quality over quantity, focusing on what matters.

## Moving Forward

[TODO: Add specific goals and next steps]

## Wrapping Up

[TODO: Add conclusion thoughts]
