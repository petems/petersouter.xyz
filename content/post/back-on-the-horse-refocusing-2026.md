Well... it's been far too long since I've posted anything here!

I feel like I say this every year, but this seemed _especially_ so in 2025. As always it was very eventful:

* Jumped on the agentic coding bandwagon once Claude Code was released
* Finally got back on the conference-speaking horse with a talk at TestCon 2025
* Travel, so much travel!
* So many side projects and things I was tweaking, with my tinkering ways accelerated by the new GenAI world...

## The Realization

Looking at my backlog recently, I realized I've been spreading myself too thin across various projects. I'm not quite getting into the depths of deep burnout, and I'm enjoying what I've delivered and learnt, I realised it makes more sense to bump up this website to the top of the pile: it's been a while, and a lot has changed with the setup:

* The Terraform setup is several years old at this point, with both the AWS provider and Terraform itself massively changed
* CircleCI has stumbled and fell a long way since when I originally deployed everything, and Github Actions is the new king to the easy-to-setup CICD roost
* The actual authentication of AWS that Terraform and the various tools to sync the website content into the remote S3 bucket are also both out of date and not following best practise. There's defintely some improvements we can make there with OpenID Connect
* The Hugo release (0.5!) and the theme are also pretty old at this point, and causing both incomaptibilities and missing out on a bunch of new Hugo features

## Yakshaves Everywhere

Various blockers to get stuff done etc -

## The Website Updates

[TODO: Expand on specific plans for updating the infrastructure]

- Terraform configuration modernization
- Moving away from CircleCI to... [GitHub Actions? Other?]
- Other infrastructure improvements

## AI, Burnout, and Finding Balance

Of course, it's almost impossible to talk about tech in 2026 without mentioning AI. It's allowed me to massively power through all the various side projects and OSS work that I enjoy doing. But I definitely hit an AI burnout moment recently.

[TODO: Elaborate on the AI experience - what worked, what didn't, specific examples]

I'm trying to scale back now and stick to closing off existing projects and doing things that genuinely make me happy. Quality over quantity, focusing on what matters.

## Moving Forward

[TODO: Add specific goals and next steps]

## Wrapping Up

[TODO: Add conclusion thoughts]
