## Testing Puppet on Windows

So as someone who's been doing way more work on Windows recently,  I've become super interested in how to do systems acceptance testing on Windows.

I ended up pairing with Liam at the Contributor Summit at  Config Management Camp 2015 about this, as Liam's behind a lot of the original work to get cygwin-less Beaker working for testing. Go read [his](http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/) [blog](http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-2-the-windows-story/) [posts](http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/) over on the OpenTable, he knows way more about the background than I do!

So, there were just a few cygwin Windows hold-overs that were left that were causing some issues.

A few pull-requests later at the contributor summit, and we got Beaker working with the OpenTable Windows VM's, which have Bitvise installed on them already. So basically, as long as Vagrant had a way to ssh onto the machine and be in a Powershell like environment, the tests would work.

The main canary we were using was the [windows_feature](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-windowsfeature) module, which was the inspiration to enable cygwin-less Windows testing, as it was literally impossible to test with cygwin:

> Installing Windows features requires elevated permissions. What this meant is that when Beaker attempted to SSH into our Windows box and our Puppet module ran its underlying PowerShell we were faced with a harsh and non-descriptive “Access is denied error”.

&mdash;<cite>http://tech.opentable.co.uk/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-2-the-windows-story/</cite>

The [windows_feature](https://github.com/puppet-community/puppet-windowsfeature/) module has a pretty simple set of tests that looks like this:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper_acceptance'

describe 'windowsfeature' do
  context 'windows feature should be installed' do
    it 'should install .net 3.5 feature' do

      pp = <<-PP
        windowsfeature { 'as-net-framework': }
      PP

      apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures => true)
      expect(apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures => true).exit_code).to be_zero
    end

    describe windows_feature('as-net-framework') do
      it { should be_installed.by('powershell') }
    end
  end
end
```

Pretty simple test, but we can actually refactor it further:
```ruby
apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures => true)
      expect(apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures => true).exit_code).to be_zero
```

can be translated to:

```ruby
apply_manifest(pp, :catch_failures => true)
apply_manifest(pp, :catch_changes  => true)
```

There's also the issue that some Windows boxes might have [out-dated SSL certificates](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/76189/why-does-windows-ship-with-expired-ssl-certificates), meaning that you get an SSL fail when trying to install modules from the forge.

You can solve this with some code that looks like this:

```ruby
GEOTRUST_GLOBAL_CA = <<-EOM

```

However, Liam went the extra mile and turned this into a helper method, so you can just do this with a simpler `install_cert_on_windows` method:

```

For a while it was hard to keep cadence with the rapid releases of Beaker and make sure the non-cygwin logic was working. For a while we were pinning to forked versions of the Gems:

```ruby
gem "beaker",
    :git => 'https://github.com/petems/beaker-windows.git',
    :ref => '38227e3bec946dbd52ac4aece8d28af360a33cc4'
gem "beaker-rspec",
    :git => 'https://github.com/petems/beaker-rspec-windows.git',
    :ref => 'd96cff5fc937efe1dca03c6ea3c236bf4c7337ab'
```

Obviously this is kinda bad, as it led to a maintence headache as we've basically got code that will be out of date with upstream, and it'll be hard to rebase with any new features. But it was a workaround until we could cherry-pick the changes back upstream.

After that I was engaged on other projects and lost track of things, until a tweet popped up to remind me:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/liamjbennett">@liamjbennett</a> Any pointers or examples for using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Beaker?src=hash">#Beaker</a> with Windows?

Josh was super helpful in getting a few of the main issues fixed, particularly the serverspec tests that required WinRM working. So thank you for that Josh!

But they were still on the fork, and I was still busy so it dropped to the bottom of my to-do list...

## Someone picks up the mantle!

Eventually, James picked up the mantle, squashed mine and Josh's commits into a nice PR and submitted it back.

https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/1113

Followed by Oskar doing the same for Beaker-rspec:

https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker-rspec/pull/77

## The Proof in the Pudding:

So now both were merged in and tagged, I could just update the Gemfile to pin to the specific tags in the Windows feature module:

```ruby
group :system_tests do
  gem 'winrm', '1.8.1'
  gem 'beaker', '2.43.0'
  gem 'beaker-rspec', '5.3.0'
  gem 'beaker-puppet_install_helper',  :require => false
end
```

Then run the acceptance tests and see if it worked...

```bash
bundle exec rake acceptance
/opt/rubies/2.0.0-p451/bin/ruby -I/opt/rubies/2.0.0-p451/lib/ruby/gems/2.0.0/gems/rspec-core-3.4.4/lib:/opt/rubies/2.0.0-p451/lib/ruby/gems/2.0.0/gems/rspec-support-3.4.1/lib /opt/rubies/2.0.0-p451/lib/ruby/gems/2.0.0/gems/rspec-core-3.4.4/exe/rspec spec/acceptance

## The Future

[Microsoft are bringing OpenSSH to Windows officially](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/06/03/looking-forward-microsoft-support-for-secure-shell-ssh.aspx). Hopefully with this, having to use proprietary software such as Bitvise to log in will be a thing of the past. Heck, the new [Ubuntu on Windows](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/03/30/run-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/) might even mean that Linux flavor code could be ported over too!
