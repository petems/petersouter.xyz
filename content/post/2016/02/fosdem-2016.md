Man, nothing excites and/or terrifies me more than speaking in public.

Speaking at FOSDEM has been a goal of mine, ever since I learned of its existence in 2014. Such a huge event, so many people, so many awesome talks to hear.

When I got accepted this year, I got the familiar feeling: joy of being accepted, the nagging dread of the upcoming event.

I learnt the hard way that speaking at FOSDEM is very different than just visiting. I ended up missing out a lot of the first day because I was panicking in my hotel room doing some last minute changes to slides after talking to a few people the night before.

In the end, I needn't have worried. The talk went great, and I got some awesome feedback and answered a lot of questions. I'm thinking of tweaking it a bit after talking to some people about their practical steps

It was a great experience and I'm super grateful to the FOSDEM organisers and the awesome friends and colleagues who helped me with my slides and gave me advice for my talk.
