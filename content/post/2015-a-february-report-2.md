So it's now February. A little over a month ago I was on a plane headed Portland, Oregon for my training for my new job at Puppetlabs. Since then I've been to 3 cities I've never been before, traveled more and met more new people in a month than I had for the whole of last year!

##### Portland!

One of my favourite things so far has been being able to break away from the long engagements that is previously been working on. I was previously working on large Government projects that were at least a year. On the Rural Payments project, I was working for a year, and there were people who'd been on the project for 18 months before I arrive, and I wouldn't be surprised if people were still there in 18 months time. 

## Puppet stuff

The thing I've been learning a lot recently is Windows stuff, as it's something I've only touched the surface on before now. Things like powershell, chocolatey and how to test Puppet with Windows and beaker mainly, I've learnt a lot in the 2 or 3 weeks I've been using them.

## Resolutions

So this post also continues my New Years resolution to blog and post more this year. However, I've realised I've mainly been blogging about work and tech, and I need to break away from tech stuff every once in a while. 

So lets talk about some other things...

## Kettlebells and Fitbits

Continuing my plan to get fitter and healthier, I'm starting up my kettlebell routine again. Kettlebells are awesome, take up minimum space, super easy to get into and even a basic routine gets your heart rate up super fast. I've done the 10'000 swing challenge with a 16KG Kettlebell last year, which was killer. I managed to lose about 1-2KG just over that month, my resting heart rate droped about 10 bpm, and according to my fairly innacurate body-fat measuring scale I lost 2-3% bodyfat. Which is pretty awesome.

#### Probably the best fitness book name ever

I also bit the bullet and got a Fitbit. It's funny how much impact just seeing how much walking around in a day you do does for your motivation to actually get out the house, get some fresh air and walk around a bit.

##### The steps I'd hit when I was finishing up this blog post...

A Saturday ago, I had a fairly sedentary day with Iyishia, ate pizza and watched DVDs all day. By 6pm I'd walked around 1000 steps. Seeing how little I'd actually done spurred me to go to the gym, and walk there rather than bus it (even though it's freezing right now!). My daily target is 10'000 steps right now, but I'll probably bump up to 15'000 soon.

## Writing

I also got the awesome Sparkbook notebook. It's normally my partner who's the stainoary obsessive, but I've got more into writing things down recently. There's some study that writing down notes is way more effective way of remembering things than typing or just listening. I also get really distracted when writing on a laptop, and having some handwritten notes as a basic skeleton of ideas has been really useful for me to get more writing done.

With that in mind, I've also been using the awesome OSX app Desk app for writing. Since I get easily distracted, and having an app that lets me write markdown whilst also being super minimalist and auto-saving to all the normal places has really helped me get more writing done.

##### This very post being written in Desk

Desk hasn't got [Ghost integration yet](http://t.co/MViSHi25v6), and I was going to wait for it, but then I ended up reading the blog about it and I was touched by the passion that the developer had and how he was doing business in the open, reporting how much the app was making and such, so I ended up just buying it anyways. I'm really liking it so far.

**Things to do:**

* Create basic Vagrant box setup for installing chocolatey and write a blog post about it
* Write more in my Sparkbook (maybe take some photos)
* Get to 20k steps one day using Fitbit
* Write a write-up about my experience with the Kettlebell 10k Swings Routine
