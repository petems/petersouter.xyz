So, I looked at my blog and realised I didn't blog at all in 2017.

Honestly, it was a pretty evenful year for me, so I think I have a good excuse:

* I switched roles at Puppet, changing from Pro Service Engineer to Techinical Account Manager
* I got married
* I went on a two week honeymoon
* And right at the end of the year, I had a baby
* I did a lot of travel, not quite as much as 2016, but a lot:

So, these conditions are not exactly condusive for a heavy blogging world.

And to be honest, I didn't have much to blog about. It was actually a great year personally, in spite of the craziness happening on a global level.

Hopefully I'll get more blogging done in 2018.
