It's now 4th of January 2015, and it's about this time people start looking back on the past year and reflect and talk about what they're looking to do in the upcoming year. 

So in terms of the biggest event in 2014-2015, it's probably me starting a new job: I'm off to work at Puppetlabs. I'm actually writing this blog-post right now in [Powells](http://www.powells.com/) in Portland, as I'm over in Oregon for training!

It's also the time of year people start thinking of new years resolutions and targets to start doing. So here are mine:

## Write more

One of the things I keep meaning to do is blog more. I have a ton of little 2-liner notes on my phone for things I want to write up and research, but 2014 was a pretty busy year and I didn't write as much as I'd like. So this is my initial attempt.

## Get on the Vi(m) train

I've been slowly weaning myself away from more complex IDE's and onto more lightweight fare for a while. I started of in Intelij with plugins way back in 2007, then Textmate, then Sublime. But I've always wanted to get good at vi. I mean, I know enough to make a couple of one-line changes, and even do a little copy and paste (it'd hard to do some basic server admin tasks if you didn't!). But I've been meaning to go full vim soon. So today I'm installing [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim) and forcing myself to stop using Sublime to get myself used to it.

## Pick up some mothballed projects

I have a lot of repos on Github. A lot of them are half-done, or just prototypes. So I'm going to go back to a lot of things and try to either:

* Bring it up to date, see if it still works, add more tests
* Tie it up in a satisfactory way so it at least gives me a vague sense of completion and satisfaction.

In particular, my [vagrant plugin to install puppet](https://github.com/petems/vagrant-puppet-install) and getting my own auto-mated tests for the various platforms for it is top of my to-do list.

## Do more Stack Overflow-ing

This is a bit of a cheat one, as I already started this mid-2014:

Rep from 2013-early 2014:
![](/content/images/2016/10/Screen_Shot_2015_01_04_at_15_15_43.png)

Rep from Mid-2014 until now:
![](/content/images/2016/10/Screen_Shot_2015_01_04_at_15_15_58.png)

But I'm definetly doing more reviewing and community tasks.

So bring on 2015!
