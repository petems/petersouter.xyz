So, my I may have slightly miscalculated how early I needed to get to the airport for my flight to Brussels for [FOSDEM 2014](https://fosdem.org/2014/)...

I try to get to the airport super early, as I've managed to never miss a flight, I'm normally before checkin even opens. So, I look at my ticket and I mentally add in 2 hours before I need to get there and book a taxi. Somewhere along the line, I'd managed to do this 2 hour calculation twice. So I stayed up all night and got a lift from my friends place to Heathrow.

Taxi Driver: "Err, I'm not sure if there's flights this early?"

Me: "Nope, I've checked, it's defintly..." *looks at ticket* "...damnit"

So, I ended up catching up on Boardwalk Empire for 3 hours. I couldn't even check in for 90 minutes...

So, unsuprisignly, when I got to Brussels I was pretty much dead on my feet and slept through most of the day and missed the [beer meetup on the first day](https://fosdem.org/2014/practical/beerevent/), sad times!

Other than this slightly shaky start, it was probably one of the best event's I've ever been to. Loads of talks [on pretty much every subject under the sun](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/tracks/) (except Ruby surprisingly...) and everyone was super friendly, and it was pretty easy to just end up talking to people about new technology and open-source.

The popular rooms were rammed 24/7. Being an ops person, I was mainly interested in the Configuration Management track. However, it was pretty packed...

That's the queue of people watching a talk, with every seat in the room filled. Pretty intense!

However, they recorded everything! Even though according to this post, the final videos [aren't ready yet](https://fosdem.org/2014/news/2014-02-03-videos/), but if you go to [http://video.fosdem.org/](http://video.fosdem.org/) most of the videos are already up. Go check them out!

Overall, it was an amazing experience and I'd  recommend anyone with an interest in open-source or cool and interesting new technology to go next year!
